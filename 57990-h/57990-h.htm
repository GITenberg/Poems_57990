<p><big>T</big><span class="smcap">hat</span> the longest Poem in this Collection was honoured by the notice of
your Lordship’s Right Honourable and ever-valued Relation, Mr. Fox; that
it should be the last which engaged his attention; and that some parts
of it were marked with his approbation; are circumstances productive of
better hopes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span> ultimate success, than I had dared to entertain before
I was gratified with a knowledge of them: And the hope thus raised,
leads me to ask permission that I may dedicate this Book to your
Lordship, to whom that truly great and greatly lamented Personage was so
nearly allied in family, so closely bound in affection, and in whose
mind presides the same critical taste which he exerted to the delight of
all who heard him. He doubtless united with his unequalled abilities, a
fund of good-nature; and this possibly led him to speak favourably of,
and give satisfaction to writers, with whose productions he might not be
entirely satisfied; nor must I allow myself to suppose his desire of
obliging was withholden, when he honoured any effort of mine with his
approbation: But, my Lord, as there was discrimination in the opinion he
gave; as he did not veil indifference for insipid mediocrity of
composition under any general expression of cool approval; I allow
myself to draw a favourable conclusion from the verdict of One who had
the superiority of intellect few would dispute, which he made mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span>fest
by a force of eloquence peculiar to himself; whose excellent judgement,
no one of his friends found cause to distrust, and whose acknowledged
candour no enemy had the temerity to deny.</p>

<p>With such encouragement, I present my Book to your Lordship: the Account
of the <i>Life and Writings of Lopez de Vega</i>, has taught me what I am to
expect; I there perceive how your Lordship can write, and am there
taught how you can judge of writers: my faults, however numerous, I know
will none of them escape through inattention, nor will any merit be lost
for want of discernment: My verses are before him who has written
elegantly, who has judged with accuracy, and who has given unequivocal
proof of abilities in a work of difficulty;&mdash;a translation of poetry,
which few persons in this kingdom are able to read, and in the
estimation of talents not hitherto justly appreciated: In this view, I
cannot but feel some apprehension: but I know also, that your Lordship
is apprised of the great difficulty of writing well; that you will make
much allowance for failures, if not too frequently repeated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> and, as
you can accurately discern, so you will readily approve, all the better
and more happy efforts of one, who places the highest value upon your
Lordship’s approbation; and who has the honour to be,</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><i>PREFACE.</i></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">About</span> twenty-five years since, was published a Poem called <i>The
Library</i>; which, in no long time, was followed by two others, <i>The
Village</i>, and <i>The Newspaper</i>: These, with a few alterations and
additions, are here reprinted; and are accompanied by a Poem of greater
length, and several shorter attempts, now, for the first time, before
the Public; whose reception of them creates in their Author, something
more than common solicitude, because he conceives that, with the
judgement to be formed of these latter productions, upon whatever may be
found intrinsically meritorious or defective, there will be united an
enquiry into the relative degree of praise or blame, which they may be
thought to deserve, when compared with the more early attempts of the
same Writer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span></p>

<p>And certainly, were it the principal employment of a man’s life, to
compose Verses, it might seem reasonable to expect, that he would
continue to improve as long as he continued to live; though, even then,
there is some doubt whether such improvement would follow, and perhaps
proof might be adduced to shew, it would not: but when to this “<i>idle
trade</i>,” is added some “<i>calling</i>,” with superior claims upon his time
and attention, his progress in the art of Versification will probably be
in proportion neither to the years he has lived, nor even to the
attempts he has made.</p>

<p>While composing the first-published of these Poems, the Author was
honoured with the notice and assisted by the advice of the <i>Right
Honourable</i> <span class="smcap">Edmund Burke</span>: Part of it was written in his presence, and
the whole submitted to his judgement; receiving, in its progress, the
benefit of his correction: I hope therefore to obtain pardon of the
reader, if I eagerly seize the occasion, and, after so long a silence,
endeavour to express a grateful sense of the benefits I have received
from this Gentleman, who was solicitous for my more essential interests,
as well as benevolently anxious for my credit as a writer.</p>

<p>I will not enter upon the subject of his extraordinary abilities; it
would be vanity, it would be weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> in me to believe that I could
make them better known or more admired than they now are; but of his
private worth, of his wishes to do good, of his affability and
condescension; his readiness to lend assistance when he knew it was
wanted, and his delight to give praise where he thought it was deserved;
of these I may write with some propriety: all know that his powers were
vast, his acquirements various, and I take leave to add, that he applied
them, with unremitted attention, to those objects which he believed
tended to the honour and welfare of his country; but it may not be so
generally understood that he was ever assiduous in the more private
duties of a benevolent nature, that he delighted to give encouragement
to any promise of ability and assistance to any appearance of desert; to
what purposes he employed his pen, and with what eloquence he spake in
the senate, will be told by many, who yet may be ignorant of the solid
instruction as well as the fascinating pleasantry found in his common
conversation, among his friends, and his affectionate manners, amiable
disposition, and zeal for their happiness, which he manifested in the
hours of retirement with his family.</p>

<p>To this Gentleman I was indebted for my knowledge of <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Joshua
Reynolds</span>, who was as well known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span> his friends, for his perpetual fund
of good-humour, and his unceasing wishes to oblige, as he was to the
public, for the extraordinary productions of his pencil and his pen: By
him I was favoured with an introduction to <i>Doctor</i> <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, who
honoured me with his notice and assisted me, as Mr. <span class="smcap">Boswell</span> has told,
with Remarks and Emendations for a Poem I was about to publish<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: The
<i>Doctor</i> had been often wearied by applications, and did not readily
comply with requests, for his opinion; not from any unwillingness to
oblige, but from a painful contention in his mind, between a desire of
giving pleasure and a determination to speak truth. No man can, I think,
publish a work without some expectation of satisfying those who are to
judge of its merit: but I can, with the utmost regard to veracity, speak
my fears, as predominating over every pre-indulged thought of a more
favourable nature, when I was told that a judge so discerning, had
consented to read and give his opinion of the <span class="smcap">Village</span>, the poem I had
prepared for publication. The time of suspence was not long protracted;
I was soon favoured with a few words from <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>, who
observed,&mdash;‘If I knew how cau<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>tious <i>Doctor</i> <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> was in giving
commendation, I should be well satisfied with the portion dealt to me in
his letter.’&mdash;Of that letter the following is a copy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>;<br />
</p>

<p>“I have sent you back Mr. <span class="smcap">Crabbe</span>’s Poem; which I read with great
delight. It is original, vigorous, and elegant.&mdash;The alterations
which I have made, I do not require him to adopt; for, my lines
are, perhaps, not often better [than] his own: but he may take mine
and his own together, and perhaps, between them, produce something
better than either.&mdash;He is not to think his copy wantonly defaced:
A wet sponge will wash all the red lines away, and leave the pages
clean.&mdash;His Dedication<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> will be least liked: it were better to
contract it into a short sprightly Address.&mdash;I do not doubt of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Crabbe</span>’s success.</p>

<p class="c">
“I am, <span class="smcap">Sir</span>, your most humble servant,<br />
</p>

<p class="r">
“SAM: JOHNSON.”<br />
</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span></p>

<p>That I was fully satisfied, my readers will do me the justice to
believe; and I hope they will pardon me, if there should appear to them
any impropriety in publishing the favourable opinion expressed in a
private letter; they will judge, and truly, that by so doing I wish to
bespeak their good opinion, but have no design of extorting their
applause: I would not hazard an appearance so ostentatious, to gratify
my vanity, but, I venture to do it, in compliance with my fears.</p>

<p>After these was published the <span class="smcap">Newspaper</span>: it had not the advantage of
such previous criticism from my friends, nor perhaps so much of my own
attention as I ought to have given to it; but the impression was
disposed of, and I will not pay so little respect to the judgement of my
readers, as now to suppress, what they then approved.</p>

<p>Since the publication of this Poem, more than twenty years have elapsed,
and I am not without apprehension, lest so long a silence should be
construed into a blameable neglect of my own interest which those
excellent friends were desirous of promoting; or what is yet worse, into
a want of gratitude for their assistance; since it becomes me to
suppose, they considered these first attempts as promises of better
things, and their favours as stimulants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span> future exertion; and here,
be the construction put upon my apparent negligence what it <i>may</i>, let
me not suppress my testimony to the liberality of those who are looked
up to, as patrons and encouragers of literary merit, or indeed of merit
of any kind: their patronage has never been refused, I conceive, when it
has been reasonably expected or modestly required, and it would be
difficult, probably, to instance, in these times and in this country,
any one who merited or was supposed to merit assistance, but who
nevertheless languished in obscurity or necessity for want of it; unless
in those cases, where it was prevented by the resolution of impatient
pride, or wearied by the solicitations of determined profligacy.&mdash;And
while the subject is before me, I am unwilling to pass silently over the
debt of gratitude which I owe to the memory of two deceased noblemen,
<i>His Grace the late Duke of</i> <span class="smcap">Rutland</span>, and <i>The Right Honourable the
Lord</i> <span class="smcap">Thurlow</span>: sensible of the honour done me by their notice and the
benefits received from them, I trust this acknowledgement will be
imputed to its only motive, a grateful sense of their favours.</p>

<p>Upon this subject I could dwell with much pleasure; but to give a reason
for that appearance of neglect, as it is more difficult, so happily it
is less required: In truth I have, for many years, intended a
re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span>publication of these Poems, as soon as I should be able to join with
them, such other of later date, as might not deprive me of the little
credit, the former had obtained. Long indeed has this purpose been
procrastinated: and if the duties of a profession, not before pressing
upon me; if the claims of a situation, at that time untried; if
diffidence of my own judgement, and the loss of my earliest friends,
will not sufficiently account for my delay, I must rely upon the
good-nature of my reader, that he will let them avail as far as he can,
and find an additional apology in my fears of his censure.</p>

<p>These fears being so prevalent with me, I determined not to publish any
thing more, unless I could first obtain the sanction of such opinion, as
I might with some confidence rely upon: I looked for a friend who,
having the discerning taste of <i>Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Burke</span>, and the critical sagacity of
<i>Doctor</i> <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, would bestow upon my MS. the attention requisite to
form his opinion, and would then favour me with the result of his
observations: and it was my singular good fortune to gain such
assistance; the opinion of a critic so qualified, and a friend so
disposed to favour me. I had been honoured by an introduction to the
<i>Right Honourable</i> <span class="smcap">Charles-James Fox</span>, some years before, at the seat of
<i>Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Burke</span>; and being again<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span> with him, I received a promise that he
would peruse any work I might send to him previous to its publication,
and would give me his opinion. At that time, I did not think myself
sufficiently prepared; and when, afterwards, I had collected some Poems
for his inspection, I found my Right Honourable Friend engaged by the
affairs of a great empire, and struggling with the inveteracy of a fatal
disease: at such time, upon such mind, ever disposed to oblige as that
mind was, I could not obtrude the petty business of criticizing verses:
but he remembered the promise he had kindly given, and repeated an
offer, which though I had not presumed to expect, I was happy to
receive. A copy of the Poems, now first published, was immediately sent
to him, and (as I have the information from <i>Lord</i> <span class="smcap">Holland</span>, and his
Lordship’s permission to inform my Readers) the Poem which I have named
<span class="smcap">The Parish Register</span>, was heard by Mr. <span class="smcap">Fox</span>, and it excited interest
enough, by some of its parts, to gain for me the benefit of his
judgement upon the whole: Whatever he approved, the Reader will readily
believe, I have carefully retained; the parts he disliked are totally
expunged, and others are substituted, which I hope resemble those, more
conformable to the taste of so admirable a judge; nor can I deny myself
the melancholy satisfaction of adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span> that this Poem, (and more
especially the story of <i>Phœbe Dawson</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, with some parts of the second
book) were the last compositions of their kind, that engaged and amused
the capacious, the candid, the benevolent mind of this great Man.</p>

<p>The above information I owe to the favour of <i>The Right Honourable Lord</i>
<span class="smcap">Holland</span>; nor this only, but to his Lordship I am indebted for some
excellent remarks upon other parts of my MS. It was not indeed my good
fortune then to know that my verses were in the hands of a Nobleman who
had given proof of his accurate judgement as a critic, and his elegance
as a writer, by favouring the public with an easy and spirited
translation of some interesting scenes of a dramatic poet, not often
read in this kingdom: The Life of Lope de Vega was then unknown to me; I
had, in common with many English readers, heard of him, but could not
judge whether his far-extended reputation was caused by the sublime
efforts of a mighty genius, or the unequalled facility of a rapid
composer, aided by peculiar and fortunate circumstances.&mdash;That any part
of my MS. was honoured by the remarks of <i>Lord</i> <span class="smcap">Holland</span>, yields me an
high degree of satisfaction, and his Lordship will perceive the use I
have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span> made of them, but I must feel some regret when I know to what
small portion they were limited; and discerning as I do, the taste and
judgement bestowed upon the verses of Lope de Vega, I must perceive how
much my own needed the assistance afforded to one, who cannot be
sensible of the benefit he has received.</p>

<p>But how much soever I may lament the advantages lost, let me remember
with gratitude the helps I have obtained: With a single exception, every
poem in the ensuing collection has been submitted to the critical
sagacity of a gentleman, upon whose skill and candour their Author could
rely: to publish by advice of friends, has been severely ridiculed, and
that too by a poet, who probably without such advice, never made public
any verses of his own; in fact, it may not be easily determined who acts
with less discretion, the writer who is encouraged to publish his works,
merely by the advice of friends whom he consulted, or he who against
advice publishes from the sole encouragement of his own opinion: these
are deceptions to be carefully avoided, and I was happy to escape the
latter, by the friendly attentions of the <i>Reverend</i> <span class="smcap">Richard Turner</span>,
Minister of Great Yarmouth. To this gentleman I am indebted, more than I
am able to describe, or than he is willing to allow, for the time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx">{xx}</a></span>
has bestowed upon the attempts I have made. He is indeed, the kind of
critic for whom every poet should devoutly wish, and the friend whom
every man would be happy to acquire; he has taste to discern all that is
meritorious, and sagacity to detect whatsoever should be discarded; he
gives just the opinion an author’s wisdom should covet, however his
vanity might prompt him to reject it; what altogether to expunge and
what to improve he has repeatedly taught me, and, could I have obeyed
him in the latter direction as I invariably have in the former, the
public would have found this collection more worthy its attention, and I
should have sought the opinion of the critic more void of apprehension.</p>

<p>But whatever I may hope or fear, whatever assistance I have had or have
needed, it becomes me to leave my verses to the judgement of the reader,
without my endeavour to point out their merit or an apology for their
defects: yet as, among the poetical attempts of one who has been for
many years a priest, it may seem a want of respect for the legitimate
objects of his study, that nothing occurs, unless it be incidentally, of
the great subjects of Religion; so it may appear a kind of ingratitude
in a beneficed clergyman, that he has not employed his talent (be it
estimated as it may) to some patriotic purpose; as in celebrating the
unsubdued<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span> spirit of his countrymen in their glorious resistance of
those enemies, who would have no peace throughout the world, except that
which is dictated to the drooping spirit of suffering humanity by the
triumphant insolence of military success.</p>

<p>Credit will be given to me I hope, when I affirm that subjects so
interesting have the due weight with me, which the sacred nature of the
one and the national importance of the other must impress upon every
mind, not seduced into carelessness for religion, by the lethargic
influence of a perverted philosophy, nor into indifference for the cause
of our country, by hyperbolical or hypocritical professions of universal
philanthropy; but after many efforts to satisfy myself by various trials
on these subjects, I declined all further attempt, from a conviction
that I should not be able to give satisfaction to my readers: poetry of
religious nature must indeed ever be clogged with almost insuperable
difficulty: but there are doubtless to be found, poets who are well
qualified to celebrate the unanimous and heroic spirit of our
countrymen, and to describe in appropriate colours some of those
extraordinary scenes, which have been and are shifting in the face of
Europe, with such dreadful celerity; and to such I relinquish the duty.</p>

<p>It remains for me to give the reader, a brief view<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> of those articles in
the following collection, which for the first time solicit his
attention.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Parish-Register</span>, he will find an endeavour once more to describe
Village-Manners, not by adopting the notion of pastoral simplicity or
assuming ideas of rustic barbarity, but by more natural views of the
peasantry, considered as a mixed body of persons sober or profligate,
and from hence, in a great measure, contented or miserable. To this more
general description are added, the various characters which occur in the
three parts of a Register; Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials.</p>

<p>If the <span class="smcap">Birth of Flattery</span> offer no moral, as an appendage to the fable,
it is hoped, that nothing of an immoral, nothing of improper tendency
will be imputed to a piece of poetical playfulness; in fact, genuine
praise, like all other species of truth, is known by its bearing full
investigation: it is what the giver is happy that he can justly bestow,
and the receiver conscious that he may boldly accept; but adulation must
ever be afraid of enquiry, and must, in proportion to their degrees of
moral sensibility,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Be shame “to him that gives and him that takes.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The verses in p. 211, want a title, nor does the motto, although it gave
occasion to them, altogether express the sense of the writer, who meant
to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span> that some of our best acquisitions, and some of our nobler
conquests are rendered ineffectual, by the passing away of opportunity
and the changes made by time; an argument that such acquirements and
moral habits are reserved for a state of being, in which they may have
the uses here denied them.</p>

<p>In the story of <span class="smcap">Sir Eustace Grey</span>, an attempt is made to describe the
wanderings of a mind first irritated by the consequences of error and
misfortune, and afterwards soothed by a species of enthusiastic
conversion, still keeping him insane: a task very difficult, and if the
presumption of the attempt may find pardon, it will not be refused to
the failure of the poet. It is said of our Shakespeare, respecting
madness:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“In that circle none dare walk but he:”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">yet be it granted to one, who dares not to pass the boundary fixed for
common minds, at least to step near to the tremendous verge and form
some idea of the terrors that are stalking in the interdicted space.</p>

<p>“When first I had written <span class="smcap">Aaron</span>, or <span class="smcap">The Gipsey</span>; I had no unfavourable
opinion of it; and had I been collecting my verses at that time for
publication, I should certainly have included this tale. Nine years have
since elapsed, and I continue to judge the same of it, thus literally
obeying one of the directions given by the prudence of criticism to the
eagerness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span> the poet: but how far I may have conformed to rules of
more importance, must be left to the less partial judgement of the
readers.</p>

<p>The concluding poem, intitled <span class="smcap">Woman!</span>, was written at the time when the
quotation from Mr. <span class="smcap">Ledyard</span> was first made public; the expression has
since become hackneyed; but the sentiment is congenial with our
feelings, and though somewhat amplified in these verses, it is hoped
they are not so far extended as to become tedious.</p>

<p>After this brief account of his subjects, the Author leaves them to
their fate, not presuming to make any remarks upon the kinds of
versification he has chosen, or the merit of the execution; he has
indeed brought forward the favourable opinion of his friends, and for
that he earnestly hopes his motives will be rightly understood; it was a
step of which he felt the advantage while he foresaw the danger; he was
aware of the benefit, if his readers would consider him as one who puts
on a defensive armour against hasty and determined severity; but he
feels also the hazard, lest they should suppose be looks upon himself to
be guarded by his friends and so secure in the defence, that he may defy
the fair judgement of legal criticism: it will probably be said, ‘he has
brought with him his testimonials to the bar of the public;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv">{xxv}</a></span>’ and he
must admit the truth of the remark: but he begs leave to observe in
reply, that, of those who bear testimonials of any kind, the greater
numbers feel apprehension, and not security; they are indeed so far from
the enjoyment of victory or the exultation of triumph, that, with all
they can do for themselves, with all their friends have done for them,
they are, like him, in dread of examination and in fear of
disappointment.</p>

himself of such Remarks as have been communicated to him since the

much remains to be done, and must intreat the Indulgence of his Readers,

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Village Life and every care that reigns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er youthful Peasants and declining Swains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What labour yields and what, that labour past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Age, in its hour of languor, finds at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What form the real picture of the Poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demand a Song&mdash;the Muse can give no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fled are those times, when, in harmonious strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rustic Poet prais’d his native Plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Shepherds now in smooth alternate verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Country’s beauty or their Nymphs’ rehearse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still for these we frame the tender strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still in our lays fond <span class="smcap">Corydons</span> complain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Shepherds’ boys, their amorous pains reveal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only pains, alas! they never feel.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On <span class="smcap">Mincio</span>’s banks, in <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>’s bounteous reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If <span class="smcap">Tityrus</span> found the Golden Age again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Truth and Nature shall we widely stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, not where Fancy, leads the way?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy Swains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the Muses never knew their pains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They boast their Peasants’ pipes: but Peasants now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And few amid the Rural-tribe have time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To number syllables and play with rhyme;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save honest <span class="smcap">Duck</span>, what son of Verse could share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Poet’s rapture and the Peasant’s care?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the great labours of the Field degrade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the new peril of a poorer trade?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From this chief cause these idle praises spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That themes so easy, few forbear to sing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no deep thought the trifling subjects ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing of Shepherds is an easy task;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy youth assumes the common strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Nymph his mistress and himself a Swain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all, to look like her, is painted fair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">I grant indeed that Fields and Flocks have charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him that gazes or for him that farms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when amid such pleasing scenes I trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor laborious natives of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their bare heads and dewy temples play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall I dare these real ills to hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tinsel trappings of poetic pride?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which neither Groves nor happy Valleys boast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where other cares than those the Muse relates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other Shepherds dwell with other mates;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By such examples taught, I paint the Cot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Truth will paint it and as Bards will not:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you, ye Poor, of letter’d scorn complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’ercome by labour and bow’d down by time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feel you the barren flattery of a Rhyme?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can Poets sooth you, when you pine for bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By winding myrtles round your ruin’d shed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can their light tales your weighty griefs o’erpower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o’er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence a length of burning sand appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the thin harvest waves its wither’d ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rank weeds, that every art and care defy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reign o’er the land and rob the blighted rye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the ragged infant threaten war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Poppies nodding, mock the hope of toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the blue Bugloss paints the sterile soil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slimy Mallow waves her silky leaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er the young shoot the Charlock throws a shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasping Tares cling round the sickly blade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a sad splendour vainly shines around.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So looks the Nymph whom wretched arts adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betray’d by Man, then left for Man to scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose outward splendour is but folly’s dress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exposing most, when most it gilds distress.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sullen woe display’d in every face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, far from civil arts and social fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here too the lawless Merchant of the main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws from his plough th’ intoxicated Swain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Want only claim’d the labour of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vice now steals his nightly rest away.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where are the Swains, who, daily labour done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rural games play’d down the setting sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or made the pond’rous quoit obliquely fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While some huge Ajax, terrible and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engag’d some artful stripling of the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell beneath him, foil’d, while far around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoarse triumph rose and rocks return’d the sound?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now are these?&mdash;Beneath yon cliff they stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To show the freighted pinnace where to land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To load the ready steed with guilty haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fly in terror o’er the pathless waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when detected, in their straggling course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To foil their foes by cunning or by force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or yielding part (which equal knaves demand)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain a lawless passport through the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here wand’ring long, amid these frowning fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought the simple life that Nature yields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurp’d her place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a bold, artful, surly, savage race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, only skill’d to take the finny tribe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yearly dinner, or septennial bribe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wait on the shore, and as the waves run high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the tost vessel bend their eager eye;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to their coast directs its vent’rous way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their’s, or the ocean’s miserable prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wait for favouring winds to leave the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While still for flight the ready wing is spread:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So waited I the favouring hour, and fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cry’d, Ah! hapless they who still remain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who still remain to hear the ocean roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sad tenant weeps from door to door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And begs a poor protection from the poor!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But these are scenes where Nature’s niggard hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave a spare portion to the famish’d land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her’s is the fault, if here mankind complain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fruitless toil and labour spent in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet in other scenes more fair in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Plenty smiles&mdash;alas! she smiles for few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those who taste not, yet behold her store,}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore,<span class="lftspc1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wealth around them makes them doubly poor.<span class="lftspc1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or will you deem them amply paid in health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labour’s fair child, that languishes with Wealth?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go then! and see them rising with the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through a long course of daily toil to run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See them beneath the Dog-star’s raging heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the knees tremble and the temples beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o’er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The labour past, and toils to come explore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See them alternate suns and showers engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hoard up aches and anguish for their age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro’ fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then own that labour may as fatal be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these thy slaves, as thine excess to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There may you see the youth of slender frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contend with weakness, weariness, and shame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet urg’d along, and proudly loth to yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strives to join his fellows of the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till long-contending nature droops at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declining health rejects his poor repast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cheerless Spouse the coming danger sees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet grant them health, ’tis not for us to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the head droops not, that the heart is well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or will you praise that, homely, healthy fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plenteous and plain, that happy Peasants share?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you who praise would never deign to touch.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ye gentle souls, who dream of Rural ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the smooth Stream and smoother Sonnet please;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go! if the peaceful Cot your praises share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go look within, and ask if Peace be there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Peace be his&mdash;that drooping weary Sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or their’s, that Offspring round their feeble fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or her’s, that Matron pale, whose trembling hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns on the wretched hearth th’ expiring brand!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor yet can Time itself obtain for these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life’s latest comforts, due respect and ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For yonder see that hoary Swain, whose age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can with no cares except its own engage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, propt on that rude staff, looks up to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bare arms broken from the withering tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which, a boy, he climb’d the loftiest bough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He once was chief in all the Rustic-trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His steady hand the straightest furrow made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a prize he won, and still is proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the triumphs of his youth allow’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now he journeys to his grave in pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich disdain him; nay, the poor disdain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alternate masters now their slave command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when his age attempts its task in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ruthless taunts, of lazy poor complain<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oft may you see him when he tends the sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His winter-charge, beneath the hillock weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er his white locks and bury them in snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rous’d by rage and muttering in the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Why do I live, when I desire to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“At once from life and life’s long labour free?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Without the sorrows of a slow decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I, like yon wither’d leaf, remain behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Nipt by the frost and shivering in the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“There it abides till younger buds come on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“As I, now all my fellow swains are gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Then, from the rising generation thrust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It falls, like me, unnotic’d to the dust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">“These fruitful Fields, these numerous Flocks I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Are others’ gain, but killing cares to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“To me the children of my youth are lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Cool in their looks, but hasty in their words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Wants of their own demand their care; and who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Feels his own want and succours others too?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“None need my help and none relieve my woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And men forget the wretch they would not aid.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus groan the Old, till, by disease opprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They taste a final woe, and then they rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their’s is yon House that holds the Parish Poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, where the putrid vapours flagging, play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Children dwell who know no Parents’ care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parents, who know no Children’s love, dwell there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-broken Matrons on their joyless bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaken Wives and Mothers never wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dejected Widows with unheeded tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crippled Age with more than childhood-fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lame, the Blind, and, far the happiest they!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moping Idiot and the Madman gay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here too the Sick their final doom receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here brought amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixt with the clamours of the crowd below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold charities of man to man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose laws indeed for ruin’d Age provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pride imbitters what it can’t deny.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Say ye, opprest by some fantastic woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who press the downy couch, while slaves advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With timid eye, to read the distant glance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with sad prayers the weary Doctor tease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To name the nameless ever-new disease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with mock patience dire complaints endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which real pain and that alone can cure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How would ye bear in real pain to lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despis’d, neglected, left alone to die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How would ye bear to draw your latest breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all that’s wretched pave the way for death?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such is that room which one rude beam divides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naked rafters from the sloping sides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lath and mud are all that lie between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save one dull pane, that, coarsely patch’d, gives way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the rude tempest, yet excludes the day:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, on a matted flock, with dust o’erspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drooping wretch reclines his languid head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him no hand the cordial cup applies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or promise hope till sickness wears a smile.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon, a Figure enters, quaintly neat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All pride and business, bustle and conceit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With looks unalter’d by these scenes of woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bids the gazing throng around him fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carries Fate and Physic in his eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A potent Quack, long vers’d in human ills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who first insults the victim whom he kills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose murd’rous hand a drowsy Bench protect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whose most tender mercy is neglect.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Paid by the Parish for attendance here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In haste he seeks the bed where Misery lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatience mark’d in his averted eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, some habitual queries hurried o’er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without reply, he rushes on the door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His drooping Patient, long inur’d to pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ceases now the feeble help to crave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Man; and silent sinks into the grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But ere his death some pious doubts arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some simple fears which “bold bad” men despise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain would he ask the Parish Priest to prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His title certain to the Joys above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this he sends the murmuring Nurse, who calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holy Stranger to these dismal walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doth not he, the pious man, appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, “passing rich with forty pounds a year?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! no, a Shepherd of a different stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far unlike him, feeds this little Flock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday’s task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much as God or Man can fairly ask;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest he gives to Loves and Labours light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Fields the morning and to Feasts the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None better skill’d the noisy Pack to guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To urge their chace, to cheer them or to chide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Sportsman keen, he shoots through half the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And skill’d at Whist, devotes the night to play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, while such honours bloom around his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he sit sadly by the Sick Man’s bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To combat fears that ev’n the pious feel?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Man of many Sorrows sighs no more.&mdash;<span class="lftspc"> &nbsp;}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up yonder hill, behold how sadly slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bier moves winding from the vale below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lie the happy Dead from trouble free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the glad Parish pays the frugal fee:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No more the Farmer claims his humble bow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sedately torpid and devoutly dumb;<br /></span>

<h2>THE VILLAGE.</h2>

<h2>BOOK II.</h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">No</span> longer Truth, though shewn in Verse, disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But own the Village Life a life of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I too must yield, that oft amid these woes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are gleams of transient Mirth and hours of sweet Repose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as you find on yonder sportive Green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ‘Squire’s tall gate and Churchway-walk between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where loitering stray a little tribe of friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a fair Sunday when the Sermon ends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Rural Beaux their best attire put on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win their Nymphs, as other Nymphs are won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While those long wed go plain, and by degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like other Husbands quit their care to please.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of the Sermon talk, a sober crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loudly praise, if it were preach’d aloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some on the Labours of the Week look round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feel their own worth, and think their toil renown’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While some, whose hopes to no renown extend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are only pleas’d to find their Labours end.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus, as their hours glide on with pleasure fraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their careful Masters brood the painful thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much in their mind they murmur and lament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one fair day should be so idly spent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think that Heaven deals hard, to tithe their store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tax their Time for Preachers and the Poor.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet still, ye humbler friends, enjoy your Hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is your Portion, yet unclaim’d of Power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is Heaven’s gift to weary men opprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seems the type of their expected Rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yours, alas! are joys that soon decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail joys, begun and ended with the Day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or yet, while day permits those joys to reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Village vices drive them from the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See the stout Churl, in drunken fury great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike the bare bosom of his teeming mate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His naked vices, rude and unrefin’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exert their open empire o’er the mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But can we less the senseless rage despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the savage acts without disguise?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet here Disguise, the City’s vice, is seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Slander steals along and taints the Green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At her approach domestic Peace is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Domestic Broils at her approach come on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She to the Wife the Husband’s crime conveys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tells the Husband when his Consort strays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her busy tongue, through all the little state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diffuses doubt, suspicion, and debate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace, tim’rous Goddess! quits her old domain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Sentiment and Song content to reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor are the Nymphs that breathe the Rural air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fair as Cynthia’s, nor so chaste as fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These to the Town afford each fresher face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Clown’s trull receives the Peer’s embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whom, should chance again convey her down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Peer’s disease in turn attacks the Clown.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here too the ’Squire, or ’squire-like Farmer, talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How round their regions nightly pilferers walk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How from their ponds the fish are borne, and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rip’ning treasures from their lofty wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How meaner rivals in their sports delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just rich enough to claim a doubtful right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who take a licence round their fields to stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mongrel race! the Poachers of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hark! the riots of the Green begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sprang at first from yonder noisy Inn;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What time the weekly pay was vanish’d all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the slow Hostess scor’d the threat’ning wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What time they ask’d, their friendly feast to close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A final cup, and that will make them foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When blows ensue that break the arm of Toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rustic battle ends the boobies’ broil.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Save when to yonder Hall they bend their way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the grave Justice ends the grievous fray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who recites, to keep the Poor in awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Law’s vast volume&mdash;for he knows the Law.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him with anger or with shame repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The injur’d Peasant and deluded Fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lo! at his throne the silent Nymph appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail by her shape, but modest in her tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while she stands abash’d, with conscious eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some favourite Female of her Judge glides by:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who views with scornful glance the strumpet’s fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thanks the stars that made her Keeper great:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near her the Swain, about to bear for life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One certain evil, doubts ’twixt War and Wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, while the faultering Damsel takes her oath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consents to wed, and so secures them both.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet why, you ask, these humble crimes relate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why make the Poor as guilty as the Great?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To shew the Great, those mightier sons of Pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How near in vice the lowest are allied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such are their natures and their passions such,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But these disguise too little, those too much:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So shall the man of Power and Pleasure see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his own Slave as vile a wretch as he;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his luxurious Lord the Servant find<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His own low pleasures and degenerate mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And each in all the kindred vices trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of a poor, blind, bewilder’d, erring Race;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who, a short time in varied fortune past,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Die, and are equal in the dust at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, ye Poor, who still lament your fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbear to envy those you call the Great;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And know, amid those blessings they possess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are, like you, the victims of distress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Sloth with many a pang torments her slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear waits on Guilt, and Danger shakes the brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! if in life one noble Chief appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great in his name, while blooming in his years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born to enjoy whate’er delights Mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet to all you feel or fear resign’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave up joys and hopes to you unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pains and dangers greater than your own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If such there be, then let your murmurs cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think, think of him, and take your lot in peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And such there was:&mdash;Oh! grief, that checks our pride,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To deeds like thine shall noblest Chiefs aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Muse shall mourn Thee, and the World admire.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In future times, when smit with Glory’s charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The untry’d youth first quits a Father’s arms;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! be like him,” the weeping Sire shall say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Like <span class="smcap">Manners</span> walk, who walk’d in Honour’s way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“In Danger foremost, yet in Death sedate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh! be like Him in all things, but his fate!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If for that Fate such public Tears be shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Victory seems to die now <small>THOU</small> art dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall a Friend his nearer hope resign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Friend a Brother, and whose soul was thine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what bold lines shall we his grief express,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by what soothing numbers make it less?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">’Tis not, I know, the chiming of a song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all the powers that to the Muse belong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words aptly cull’d and Meanings well exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can calm the sorrows of a wounded breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Virtue, soother of the fiercest pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall heal that bosom, <span class="smcap">Rutland</span>, where she reigns.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet hard the task to heal the bleeding heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bid the still-recurring thoughts depart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tame the fierce grief and stem the rising sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curb rebellious passion, with reply;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calmly to dwell on all that pleas’d before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet to know that all shall please no more;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! glorious labour of the soul to save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her captive powers, and bravely mourn the Brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To such, these thoughts will lasting comfort give&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life is not measur’d by the time we live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis not an even course of threescore years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A life of narrow views and paltry fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grey-hairs and wrinkles and the cares they bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That take from Death, the terrors or the sting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ’tis the gen’rous Spirit, mounting high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the world, that native of the Sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble Spirit, that, in dangers brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calmly looks on, or looks beyond the grave:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such <span class="smcap">Manners</span> was, so he resign’d his breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in a glorious, then a timely death.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cease then that grief and let those tears subside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Passion rule us, be that passion Pride;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Reason, Reason bids us strive to raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fallen hearts and be like Him we praise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if Affection still the soul subdue,<span class="lftspc1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring all his virtues, all his worth in view,<span class="lftspc1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let Affection find its comfort too:<span class="lftspc1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For how can Grief so deeply wound the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Admiration claims so large a part?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grief is a foe, expel him then thy soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let nobler thoughts the nearer views controul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! make the Age to come thy better care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See other <span class="smcap">Rutlands</span>, other <span class="smcap">Granbys</span> there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as thy thoughts through streaming ages glide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See other Heroes die as <span class="smcap">Manners</span> died:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their fate, thy Race shall nobler grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As trees shoot upwards that are prun’d below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as Old <span class="smcap">Thames</span> borne down with decent pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees his young Streams run warbling at his side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though some, by art cut off, no longer run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some are lost beneath the Summer’s Sun&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the pure Stream moves on, and as it moves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its power increases and its use improves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Plenty round its spacious waves bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still it flows on, and shall for ever flow.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where Young and Old, intent on pleasure throng,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Vain search for scenes like these! no view appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sighs unruffled or unstain’d by tears;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A deed of Glory in a day of Gloom;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distressing glory! grievous boon of fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proudest Conquest, at the dearest rate.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On shelf of deal beside the cuckoo-clock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Cottage-reading rests the chosen stock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learning we lack, not Books, but have a kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all our wants, a meat for every mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tale for wonder and the Joke for whim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The half-sung Sermon and the half-groan’d Hymn.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No need of classing; each within its place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feeling finger in the dark can trace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“First from the corner, farthest from the wall,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such all the rules and they suffice for all.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There pious works for Sunday’s use are found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companions for that Bible newly bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Bible, bought by sixpence weekly sav’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has choicest prints by famous Hands engrav’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has choicest notes by many a famous Head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as to doubt, have rustic readers led;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have made them stop to reason <i>why?</i> and <i>how?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where they once agreed, to cavil now.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh! rather give me Commentators plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who with no deep researches vex the brain;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who from the dark and doubtful love to run,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And hold their glimmering tapers to the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who simple Truth with nine-fold reasons back,<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Bunyan</i>’s fam’d <i>Pilgrim</i> rests that shelf upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A genius rare but rude was honest <i>John</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one who, early by the Muse beguil’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drank from her well, the waters undefil’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one who slowly gain’d the Hill sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then often sipp’d and little at a time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one who dabbled in the sacred Springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drank them muddy, mix’d with baser things.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here to <i>interpret Dreams</i> we read the rules,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Science our own! and never taught in schools;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Moles and Specks we Fortune’s gifts discern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fate’s fix’d will from Nature’s wanderings learn.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Unbound and heap’d these valued works beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid humbler works, the pedler’s pack supplied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet these, long since, have all acquir’d a name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Wandering Jew</i> has found his way to fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fame, denied to many a labour’d song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowns <i>Thumb</i> the great and <i>Hickerthrift</i> the strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There too is he, by wizard-power upheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jack</i>, by whose arm the giant-brood were quell’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shoes of swiftness on his feet he plac’d;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His sword of sharpness in his hand he took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And off the heads of doughty Giants stroke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their glaring eyes beheld no mortal near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound of feet alarm’d the drowsy ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No English blood their pagan sense could smell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But heads dropt headlong, wondering why they fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These are the Peasant’s joy, when, plac’d at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half his delighted Offspring mount his knees.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To every Cot the Lord’s indulgent mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has a small space for Garden-ground assign’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&mdash;till return of morn dismiss’d the farm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The careful Peasant plies the sinewy arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm’d as he works and casts his look around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every foot of that improving ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is his own he sees; his Master’s eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peers not about, some secret fault to spy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor voice severe is there, nor censure known;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope, profit, pleasure,&mdash;they are all his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Here grow the humble <i>Cives</i> and hard by them,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The tall <i>Leek</i>, tapering with his rushy stem;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">High climb his Pulse in many an even row,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Deep strike the ponderous roots in soil below,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And herbs of potent smell and pungent taste,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Give a warm relish to the Night’s repast.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Apples and Cherries grafted by his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cluster’d Nuts for neighbouring market stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor thus concludes his labour; near the Cot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Reed-fence rises round some favourite spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where rich Carnations, Pinks with purple eyes,<span class="lftspc1">&nbsp; }</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Hyacinths, the least some Florist’s prize,<span class="lftspc1">&nbsp; }</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tulips tall-stemm’d and pounc’d Auricula’s rise.<span class="lftspc1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here on a Sunday-eve, when Service ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet and rejoice a Family of Friends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All speak aloud, are happy and are free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad they seem and gaily they agree.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What, though fastidious ears may shun the speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all are talkers and where none can teach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where still the Welcome and the Words are old,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That forms these tones of gladness we despise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lifts their steps, that sparkles in their eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That talks or laughs or runs or shouts or plays,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Fair scenes of peace! ye might detain us long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Vice and Misery now demand the song;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Riots are nightly heard;&mdash;the curse, the cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beaten Wife, perverse in her replies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While shrieking Children hold each threat’ning hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes life, and sometimes food demand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boys in their first stol’n rags, to swear begin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Seeking their fate, to her the simple run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her the guilty, theirs awhile to shun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mistress of worthless arts, deprav’d in will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her care unblest and unrepaid her skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slave to the tribe, to whose command she stoops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poorer than the poorest maid she dupes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Between the road-way and the walls, offence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invades all eyes and strikes on every sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lie, obscene, at every open door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaps from the hearth and sweepings from the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day by day the mingled masses grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sinks are disembogu’d and kennels flow.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There hungry dogs from hungry children steal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There pigs and chickens quarrel for a meal;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But vain the wish; I sigh and I proceed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could I well th’ instructive truth convey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twould warn the Giddy and awake the Gay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of all the Nymphs, who gave our Village grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Miller</i>’s Daughter had the fairest Face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud was the Miller; Money was his pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode to Market, as our Farmers ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ’twas his boast, inspir’d by spirits, there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His favourite <i>Lucy</i> should be rich as fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she must meek and still obedient prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not presume, without his leave, to love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A youthful <i>Sailor</i> heard him;&mdash;“Ha!” quoth he,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“My ebbing purse, no more the Foe shall fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“But Love’s kind act and <i>Lucy</i> at the Mill.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus thought the Youth, and soon the chace began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch’d all his sail, nor thought of pause or plan:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His trusty staff, in his bold hand, he took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him and like his Frigate, <i>Heart of Oak</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh were his features, his attire was new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clean was his linen and his jacket blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of finest <i>jean</i> his trowsers tight and trim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brush’d the large buckle at the silver rim.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He soon arriv’d, he trac’d the Village-green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There saw the Maid, and was with pleasure seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then talk’d of Love, till <i>Lucy</i>’s yielding heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confess’d ’twas painful, though ’twas right to part.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“For ah! my Father has an haughty soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Whom best he loves, he loves but to controul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Me to some churl in bargain he’ll consign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And make some tyrant of the Parish, mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Cold is his heart, and he with looks severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Has often forc’d, but never shed the tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Save when my Mother died, some drops express’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A kind of sorrow for a Wife at rest:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“To me a Master’s stern regard is shown,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Away to <i>Wapping</i>, and a Wife command,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">‘Revenge! Revenge!’ the angry Lover cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sought the Nymph, and ‘Be thou now my Bride.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bride had she been, but they no Priest could move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bind in Law, the Couple bound by Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What sought these Lovers then by day, by night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stolen moments of disturb’d delight;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gave&mdash;not her Hand&mdash;but <small>ALL</small> she could, she gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then came the Day of shame, the grievous Night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The varying Look, the wandering Appetite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Joy assum’d, while Sorrow dimm’d the eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forc’d sad Smiles that follow’d sudden Sighs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">Too eager caution shews some danger’s near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bully’s bluster proves the Coward’s fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sober step, the Drunkard vainly tries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nymphs expose the failings they disguise.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First, whispering <i>Gossips</i> were in parties seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then louder <i>Scandal</i> walk’d the Village-green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next babbling <i>Folly</i> told the growing ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And busy <i>Malice</i> dropt it at the Mill.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Go! to thy curse and mine,” the Father said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Strife and confusion stalk around thy bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Want and a wailing Brat thy Portion be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Plague to thy fondness, as thy fault to me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bats on their webby wings in darkness move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feebly shriek their melancholy love.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No Sailor came; the months in terror fled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then news arriv’d; He fought, and he was <small>DEAD</small>!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At the lone Cottage <i>Lucy</i> lives, and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walks, for her weekly pittance, to the Mill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mean seraglio there her Father keeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose mirth insults her, as she stands and weeps:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees the plenty, while compell’d to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Father’s pride, become his Harlot’s prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Throughout the lanes, she glides at evening’s close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And softly lulls her Infant to repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sits and gazes but with viewless look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As gilds the Moon the rimpling of the brook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sings her vespers, but in voice so low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hears their murmurs as the waters flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she too murmurs and begins to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The solemn wanderings of a wounded mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visions of terror, views of woe succeed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Love all made up of torture and delight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And <i>Robert</i> half in earnest, half in jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talk of her Spouse when he should be at rest;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Few were their Acres,&mdash;but they, well content,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“His Scorn, his Love, in playful Words he spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“His Pity, Praise, and Promise, were a Joke:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Ev’n cool Dissenters at his Table fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Who wish’d,&mdash;and hop’d,&mdash;and thought a Man so kind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“To them, to all, he was polite and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Kind to the Poor, and, ah! most kind to me:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<span class="lftspc">‘</span><i>Ralph</i>,’ would he say, ‘<i>Ralph Dibble</i>, thou art old;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">“Gay Days were these; but they were quickly past:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“When first he came, we found he cou’dn’t last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“An whoreson Cough (and at the Fall of Leaf)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Upset him quite:&mdash;but what’s the Gain of Grief?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Then came the <i>Author-Rector</i>; his Delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Was all in Books; to read them, or to write:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Women and Men, he strove alike to shun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And hurried homeward, when his Tasks were done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Courteous enough, but careless what he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“For Points of Learning he reserv’d his Head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And when addressing either Poor or Rich,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He knew no better than his Cassock which:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He, like an Osier, was of pliant kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Erect by Nature, but to bend inclin’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Not like a Creeper falling to the ground,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Careless was he of Surplice, Hood, and Band,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And kindly took them as they came to hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Nor, like the Doctor, wore a World of Hat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“As if he sought for Dignity in that:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He talk’d, he gave, but not with cautious Rules:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Nor turn’d from Gypsies, Vagabonds, or Fools;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It was his Nature, but they thought it Whim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And so our Beaux and Beauties turn’d from him:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“How spake the Serpent, and where stopp’d the Ark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“From what far Land the Queen of Sheba came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Who Salem’s Priest and what his Father’s Name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He made the Song of Songs its Mysteries yield,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">When</span> the sad Soul, by Care and Grief opprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks round the World, but looks in vain, for Rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every Object that appears in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partakes her Gloom and seems dejected too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shall Affliction from itself retire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fade away and placidly expire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! we fly to silent Scenes in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care blasts the Honours of the flow’ry Plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care veils in Clouds the Sun’s meridian Beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighs through the Grove and murmurs in the Stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when the Soul is labouring in Despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the Body breathes a purer Air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No storm-tost Sailor sighs for slumbering Seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dreads the Tempest, but invokes the Breeze;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the smooth Mirror of the Deep resides<span class="lftspc1">

<span class="i0">The Ghost of every former Danger glides.<span class="lftspc1">
}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus in the Calms of Life, we only see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A steadier Image of our Misery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lively Gales and gently-clouded Skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disperse the sad Reflections as they rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And busy Thoughts and little Cares avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ease the Mind, when Rest and Reason fail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the dull Thought, by no Designs employ’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells on the past, or suffer’d or enjoy’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We bleed anew in every former Grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Joys departed furnish no Relief.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not Hope herself, with all her flattering Art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can cure this stubborn Sickness of the Heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Soul disdains each Comfort she prepares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anxious searches for congenial Cares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those lenient Cares, which, with our own combin’d,<span class="lftspc1">

<span class="i0">A lighter Grief! which feeling Hearts endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without regret, nor ev’n demand a Cure.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The troubled Mind to change its native Woes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lead us willing from ourselves, to see<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This, Books can do;&mdash;nor this alone; they give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New Views to Life and teach us how to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They soothe the Griev’d, the Stubborn they chastise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fools they admonish and confirm the Wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their aid they yield to all; they never shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Man of Sorrow, nor the Wretch undone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlike the Hard, the Selfish, and the Proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fly not sullen from the suppliant Crowd;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Cronic Habits of the sickly Soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round the Heart and o’er the aching Head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mild Opiates here, their sober Influence shed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now bid thy Soul, Man’s busy Scenes exclude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view compos’d this silent Multitude:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent they are, but, though depriv’d of Sound,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why then denies the studious Man to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man’s common Good, who feels his common Care?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Night’s soft Repose and Sleep’s mild Power defy;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Fame’s fair Meed be his, for length of days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delightful Prospect! when we leave behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy Offspring of the fruitful Mind!<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
